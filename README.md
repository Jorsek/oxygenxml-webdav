# oxygenxml-webdav

Step 1 - Install plugin

Unzip to oXygen pluing folder.

Step 2 - Run installation script

Open terminal, run `cd /Applications/oXygen/pluging/webdav/bin` and then `./setup_osx_webdav.sh`

Step 3 â€“ Make finder aware of our app

This step is very counter-intuitive but locate your `oXygen` folder at `Application` and move it to another folder, perhaps your home folder and back. Moving the file will let Finder re-read the Info.plist file and register it as a protocol handler.
